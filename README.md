## ♠️ Hearts

An intelligent agent developed with Haskell to compete against other players in the game of Hearts.

The game of Hearts[^1] is a trick-taking game where the goal to score as *few
points* as possible.  All cards in the Hearts are worth one point, and the
Queen of Spade is worth 13.  Your task will be to implement a simple AI to beat
other players (students and staff) at this game.

There will be two versions of the game:

 1. A two-player version, which will be used to assess the *strength* the
    player.  This version will use calibrated opponents and can be seen as a
    test.
 2. An online tournament where the player will be pitted against other AIs in
    four-player matches.
